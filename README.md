VENu-Demo
To make this project work you must have an Oculus Rift and Touch Controllers.
Download and unzip the project.
Double click on the application file and wait for it to load.
The right controller is the only one needed.
A and B buttons scroll through events.
The thumbstick is for motion (the direction of the controller is the forward direction).
The trigger allows for rotation, point your controller in the direction you wish to turn and squeeze the trigger.
